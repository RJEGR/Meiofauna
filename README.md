# Meiofauna
Database curation and data visualization support for Meiofauna metabarcoding data. 

Meiofauna is an ecological group defined as an “assemblage of benthic metazoans. It typically the meiofauna of the deep-sea sediments is composed mainly of Nematodes as the most abundant group, reaching proportions many times greater than 90%, followed by harpactidoid copepods and annelids, and by less abundant groups such as Arthropoda, Mollusca, Kinorhyncha, Gastrotricha, Tardígrada, Platyhelminthes, among others (CELIZ, J. A. C. (2018). Meiofaunal biodiversity of deep-sediments from the Gulf of Mexico: a metabarcoding and morphological approach for the establishment of a baseline)
